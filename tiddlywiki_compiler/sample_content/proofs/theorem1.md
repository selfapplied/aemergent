# Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

**Theorem**: Every integer greater than 1 is either prime or can be uniquely factored into prime numbers.

**Proof**: 
1. Existence: Assume some integer n > 1 cannot be factored. 
2. Let S be the set of all such integers.
3. By well-ordering, S has a minimum element m.
4. Since m cannot be factored, m must be prime.
5. This contradicts our assumption.

Therefore, every integer can be factored into primes.

**Demo**: 12 = 2² × 3, 15 = 3 × 5, 30 = 2 × 3 × 5

This theorem is fundamental to number theory and cryptography.

How does this relate to the distance metrics in prime space?
