Key Mathematical Concepts

Prime Numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29...
Fibonacci Sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34...
Factorials: 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720...

Distance Metrics:
- Euclidean: d(x,y) = √(Σ(xi-yi)²)
- Manhattan: d(x,y) = Σ|xi-yi|
- Hamming: number of differing positions

Computational Complexity:
- O(1): constant time
- O(log n): logarithmic 
- O(n): linear time
- O(n log n): linearithmic
- O(n²): quadratic time
