# Welcome to the Mathematical Wiki

This wiki demonstrates the TiddlyWiki compiler's ability to structure and organize mathematical content.

## Features

- **Automatic tagging** based on content patterns
- **Distance-metric compression** using blockprimes concepts  
- **Structured tiddlers** with summaries and key concepts
- **Interactive filtering** by tags and search

## Sample Content

The blockprimes.md file has been automatically broken down into multiple tiddlers, each with:
- Summary sections
- Key concept extraction
- Automatic tagging (proof, demo, question, etc.)
- Follow-up question detection

**Example**: Mathematical proofs are automatically tagged as "proof" and formatted with special styling.

What patterns will you discover in your own content?
