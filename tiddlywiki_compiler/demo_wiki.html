Existence: Assume some integer n > 1 cannot be factored. \n2. Let S be the set of all such integers.\n3. By well-ordering, S has a minimum element m.\n4. Since m cannot be factored, m must be prime.\n5. This contradicts our assumption.\n\nTherefore, every integer can be factored into primes.\n\n**Demo**: 12 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3, 15 = 3 \u00d7 5, 30 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5\n\nThis theorem is fundamental to number theory and cryptography.\n\nHow does this relate to the distance metrics in prime space?\n",
